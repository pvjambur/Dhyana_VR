## Virtual Reality Therapy & Rehabilitation for Vertigo
#### Background: Vertigo is a debilitating condition characterized by a sensation of spinning and dizziness, which can significantly impact an individualâ€™s quality of life. Traditional therapeutic approaches often involve physical therapy and medication, but these may not be sufficient for all patients.
#### The objective was to develop a Virtual Reality (VR) Therapy & Rehabilitation platform that leverages the immersive and controlled environment of VR to create a blissful space for meditation.
