"Thought ceases in meditation; even the mind’s elements are quite quiet. Blood circulation stops. His breath stops, but he/she is still alive."
~ Swami Vivekananda (1896)

## Virtual Reality Therapy & Rehabilitation for Vertigo
Cure Vertigo anywhere & anytime, with one click of a button, and teleport yourself to multiple scenic ecosystems and environments. Background audio stimulates deep breathing based on dynamic HRV & pulse monitoring integrated with 'frequency therapy principles'.

### Background: 
Vertigo is a debilitating condition characterized by a sensation of spinning and dizziness, which can significantly impact an individual’s quality of life. Traditional therapeutic approaches often involve physical therapy and medication, but these may not be sufficient for all patients. We aim to create a to-go product which can simulate a peaceful environment through virtual reality, stimulating a state of bliss in our minds. 


### Objective :
To develop a Virtual Reality (VR) Therapy & Rehabilitation platform built through 'Swift' (integrated with Vision Pro dynamics) that leverages the immersive and controlled environment to create a blissful space for meditation.
The user can wear the VR headset on the go; isolated VR headset "Apple Vision Pro". Vertigo being the most common mental - health issue faced by millions across the world, has been increasing at an alarming rate, due to mordern life routines, habits & lifestyles. Further parameters such as heart rate, spO2 (blood oxygen) & pulse rate can be measured through the "Apple Watch Series 9".

Traditional vertigo therapy involves deep breathing, yoga and a combination of ayurvedic and synthetic medications giving temporary relief. However, our objective is to emphasize deep breathing & yoga; integrated with music therapy for HRV, frequency therapy for & the mind & image - sound sensory combination to improve the breathing cycle. We use multiple neurobiology and cardiovascular terms to generate an overall progress report of the person.

## Project Highlights 

### Heart Rate, HRV & Pulse interpolation
Based on the monitored heart rate and pulse, we can interpolate the dynamic HRV of the person. Two main formulas are used to calculate HRV: RMSSD and SDNN.

#### RMSSD - the root mean square of successive differences
A standard statistical measure of HRV. It stands for the root mean square of successive differences. RMSSD HRV measures the time difference between each successive heartbeat in real-time to arrive at your RMSSD score, meaning you can see the result at the exact moment. This formula helps investigate the impact of training loads and recovery processes.

Researchers have proposed the following HRV RMSSD normal ranges in different studies:

19 – 48 ms — healthy adults in the age group of 38 – 42 years
35 – 107 ms — elite athletes

An important feature of RMSSD is that it characterizes short-term rapid changes in heart rate, which can only occur under the influence of the parasympathetic nervous system. It is important to assess the performance of the parasympathetic system and analyze HRV, taking into account rapidly changing metrics.

#### SDNN - the standard deviation of NN intervals
SDNN is a measure of HRV that calculates the average value of HRV in milliseconds and shows how far your HRV is from that average at any point in the day. Although it is often calculated in 24 hours.
The SDNN is considered the “gold standard” for medical stratification of cardiac risk. SDNN values predict both morbidity and mortality.

Heart attack patients with SDNN values over 100 ms have been reported to have a 5.3 lower mortality risk than those with under 50 ms.

#### pNN50 - another notable measure of HRV

Shows how active your parasympathetic system is relative to the sympathetic nervous system. The higher the value, the more relaxed the body is. If the pNN50 is low, you’re either tired or over-stressed.
This measure helps assess parasympathetic activity from 24-hour ECG recordings, and the study presented supporting data by comparing pNN50 values in healthy subjects with those with diabetes mellitus and patients who’ve had a heart transplant.

### Audio and HRV interpolation

These factors are the major connectors between HRV monitoring and music therapy. Let us go in deep and understand the factors which interpolate and graph parameters from audio and HRV inputs.

#### HRV Frequency Measurements (LF, HF, LF/HF)
